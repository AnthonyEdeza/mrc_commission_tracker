# üí∞ MRC Commission Tracker
### Automating the Processing of Monthly Recurring Commission Reports

**Tech Stack:** Python ¬∑ Pandas ¬∑ NumPy ¬∑ XlsxWriter ¬∑ Regex ¬∑ Calendar ¬∑ Google Colab

---

## üîç Executive Summary
The **MRC Commission Tracker** automates the monthly consolidation and calculation of **recurring commission payments** across multiple CSV reports.  
It was designed to eliminate repetitive manual work in tracking multi-month payment cycles and determining expected future commission dates.

Using **Python (Pandas)** inside **Google Colab**, this workflow:
- Reads all monthly commission CSVs in the working directory.  
- Cleans and filters data to exclude inactive or zero-balance accounts.  
- Calculates **future MRC payment dates** (2nd MRC ‚Üí +48 days, 3rd MRC ‚Üí +96 days, 4th MRC ‚Üí +144 days).  
- Compiles all processed data into a single Excel workbook with separate sheets per period.  

This automation replaced a repetitive spreadsheet process and provided a repeatable, structured method to forecast MRC payouts with improved accuracy and speed.

## üíº Business Problem
Commission analysts previously relied on manually combining exported reports, which led to:
- Inconsistent date calculations across months.  
- Difficulty identifying active vs. deactivated accounts.  
- Frequent formula and copy-paste errors.  
- Hours of repetitive cleanup for every commission cycle.

## üí° Solution
The **MRC Commission Tracker** automates the entire workflow:  

1. **Import:** Reads all `.csv` files in the current working directory.  
2. **Clean:** Filters out entries with `0 Total Commissions to Date`, null `Deactivation Date`, or `ACP` plans.  
3. **Transform:** Calculates subsequent MRC payment milestones based on the first payment date.  
4. **Load:** Outputs a single consolidated Excel file with three sheets ‚Äî 2nd MRC, 3rd MRC, and 4th MRC forecasts.  
5. **Export:** Downloads the combined workbook directly from Google Colab.

## üß∞ Tools and Methods

| Stage | Purpose | Libraries / Tools |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Data Ingestion | Read multiple CSV files | `pandas`, `os`, `re` |
| Data Filtering | Remove inactive / zero-commission entries | `pandas` queries |
| Date Calculations | Compute 2nd ‚Üí 4th MRC payment dates | `pandas`, `datetime`, `timedelta` |
| Data Output | Write multi-sheet Excel file | `xlsxwriter`, `pandas.ExcelWriter` |
| Environment | Notebook automation / file download | `Google Colab` |

## üìÇ Input Data

This notebook expects CSV files exported from a commission reporting system.  
Each file typically follows this naming pattern:

mmmYYYYHHMM.csv

For testing purposes, **three sanitized CSVs** are included in this repository:  
jun20230905_SANITIZED.csv
jul20230915_SANITIZED.csv
aug20230915_SANITIZED.csv

## üßæ Example Output
> üß© **Output:** `combined_mrc_sheets.xlsx`  
> A consolidated Excel workbook generated automatically by the script.  
> Each sheet (e.g., `Jan_2nd MRC`, `Jan_3rd MRC`, `Jan_4th MRC`) contains all qualifying accounts and projected commission dates.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note:* These are **fully sanitized test files** that contain randomly generated, non-identifiable data.  
> They are safe for public demonstration and reproduce the same structure as the original datasets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### Option 1 ‚Äî Google Colab
1. Upload `mrc_commission_tracker.ipynb` to your Google Drive.  
2. Open in **Google Colab**.  
3. Upload your monthly CSV files into the Colab working directory.  
4. Run all cells.  
5. When complete, the combined Excel file will automatically download to your device.

### Option 2 ‚Äî Local Execution (optional)
You can also run it locally with:
```bash
python mrc_commission_tracker.ipynb
(requires Python ‚â• 3.9, pandas, xlsxwriter)
